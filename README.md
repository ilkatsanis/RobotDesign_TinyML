# RobotDesign_TinyML
This is the repo for the development of machine learning models, deployed on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, and the machine vision algorithms used in a Social Robot.

The repo contains the dataset for the developed models, the code for the machine learning models and machine vision and the results of testing the models on Arduino.
