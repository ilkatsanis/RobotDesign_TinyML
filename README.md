# RobotDesign_TinyML
This is the repo for the development of machine learning models, deployed on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, and the machine vision algorithms used in a Social Robot.

The repo contains the dataset for the developed models, the code for the machine learning models and machine vision and the results of testing the models on Arduino.

IMPORTANT: Due to the big size of speech dataset, the whole dataset can be downloaded from the public version of the model.

- Public versions of models could be found accordingly:
1) speech detection model: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/83040/latest
2) motion classification model: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/88208/latest
